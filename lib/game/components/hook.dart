/// The crane hook + the block currently being teased above the tower.
///
/// Movement:
///   * The hook **slides horizontally** above the playfield. No rotation, no
///     pendulum arc.
///   * The hook is **anchored to the top of the camera viewport**, NOT to the
///     tower. As the tower grows and the camera pans up, the hook follows the
///     camera so it always stays at the top of the screen — it never appears
///     to "fall" with the tower.
///
/// Block geometry:
///   * The block hangs from the hook via two diagonal chains forming an
///     inverted V (Λ).
///   * The block's vertical position is anchored to the current tower top
///     ([topY] - [GameConstants.hookBlockOffsetAboveTop] - blockHeight/2),
///     same as before.
///   * Because the hook is at the top of the camera and the block is at a
///     fixed offset above the tower top, the chain length on screen stays
///     visually constant (camera always centres on the tower top region).
///
